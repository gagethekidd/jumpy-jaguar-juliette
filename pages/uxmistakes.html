        <p><br>Year after year, UNA enrollment continues to increase. However, more parking spots never follow. This leads to students parking erroniously, previously resulting in paper tickets. Nowadays, we do everything online, including parking tickets. <br><br> At its peak, UNA parking portal is convenient. <br> At its worst, it can be an incredibly frustrating experience that will make you okay with having a hold on your account.</p><br>
        <p>The first thing you need to access your parking portal is your password. This password is different from your Canvas and Portal password, so it is easily forgotten. This is when a student might like to reset their password.</p><br>

        <br><p>It looks simple enough, but upon attempting to change your password you quicly notice you have not been informed of the password requirements. You must now play a guessing game.</p>
        <img class ="overallScreen" src="../img/pw_error_1.png" width="800" height="400" alt="Example of Payment Form">
        <p><br>As you can see, I was only told of 1 requirement after I had already unsuccessfully changed my password. This would not have happened if I was aware of the requirements.</p><br/>
        <p>In order to allow students to update their password as easily as possible, the form should provide the password requiremetns. This will prevent repeated failed password change attempts, saving students time and frustration.</p>
